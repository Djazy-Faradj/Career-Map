# **Global Exploration Platform for Students**

## **Overview**
This project is a personalized global exploration platform designed to help students and young professionals identify the best destinations for their goals, preferences, and budget. By analyzing key economic, lifestyle, and affordability metrics, the platform provides tailored recommendations to empower users to confidently explore the world.

---

## **Features**
- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Generates personalized destination suggestions based on salary-to-GDP ratio, purchasing power index (PPI), unemployment rate, and income group.
- **Scoring System**: Ranks destinations with a clear color-coded system:
  - **Green**: Strong compatibility.
  - **Yellow**: Moderate compatibility.
  - **Red**: Low compatibility.
- **Interactive View**: Allows users to visualize data interactively.
- **Practical Guidance**: Offers insights into job opportunities, cost of living, and lifestyle factors.

## **How It Works**
1. **Input**: Users provide basic details about their preferences (e.g., budget, desired quality of life, career aspirations).
2. **Analysis**: The platform evaluates destinations based on:
   - Salary-to-GDP ratio.
   - Purchasing power index (PPI).
   - Unemployment rate.
   - Economic group classification.
3. **Output**: Generates a ranked list of recommended destinations, with insights into each location's advantages and challenges.

## **Challenges Encountered**
1. **Cumbersome Code**: As the codebase grew, managing and scaling the functionality became challenging. Refactoring and optimization efforts are ongoing.
2. **API Usage Optimization**: Redundant API calls led to exhausting read limits during the demo phase. Implementing caching and batching is a planned improvement.
3. **Time Constraints**: Limited time necessitated reliance on AI tools for writing Firestore methods and debugging.
4. **UI Bugs**: A persistent issue with SVG clipping in the interactive view widget was resolved with the help of AI.
5. **Economic Understanding**: Without a deep background in economics, AI provided valuable guidance on critical metrics and their impact on job compatibility.
